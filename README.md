# OOPS
LIBRARY MAAGEMENT SYSTEM 
OOP is built on four main pillars:

Pillar	Meaning
Encapsulation	Grouping related data and functions in classes (hiding internal details)
Abstraction	Hiding complexity, showing only essential features
Inheritance	One class (child) can reuse/extend another class (parent)
Polymorphism	Same method name can behave differently depending on context


This is a classic OOP project simple enough to build, rich enough to learn concepts.

Project Overview
We will build a basic system to manage a library where:
1.Users can borrow and return books.
2.Admins can add or remove books.
3.You will create classes like Book, User and Library.
